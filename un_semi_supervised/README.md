Unsupervised and Semi_supervised Projects
-------------------

####Introduction
Unsupervised in fact also has x and y: when autoencoder x=x, skipgram x=center, y= contetx; sequence generative x=X[:n],y=X[n]
Semi_supervised simply merge supervied cost and unsupervied cost

####Projects
Unsupervised:
    * word2vec
    * multi_meaning [TODO]
    * generative model(draw,AE,ladder,etc) [TODO]
Semi_supervied:
    * cost1+cost2[TODO]
    * dual_learning[TODO]
